# BenchmarkiNG

Yet another useless benchmark :D

### Technology stack

* Angular 4
* ES2017

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer:
 * NodeJS
 * Yarn/npm
 * @angular/cli
 * Chromium-based browser

## Installation

Run `yarn`

## Running / Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `./chromium replace-with-chromium-location` to open Chromium with correct flags.

### Building

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

### Code style

As set in `tslint.json`

### Browser support

* Chromium 60 and later

Currently no other browsers are supported.
